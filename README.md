<h3>Future Goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>increased mobile responsiveness</li>
<li>introductory game phase where user can choose a specific plant (level easy, medium, or hard) and customize their plant's "home" (background color, change pot, etc.)</li>
<li>increased complexity of gameplay, for example, if user waters plant too often, it decreases plant's health</li>
