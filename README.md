Future Goals:
increased mobile responsiveness, introductory game phase where user can choose a specific plant (level easy, medium, or hard) and customize their plant's "home" (background color, change pot, etc.), increased complexity of gameplay, for example, if user waters plant too often, it decreases plant's health
